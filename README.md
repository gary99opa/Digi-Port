Digi-Port - The Sound Solution
AUDIO-BYTE  v1.03.9109.14 (BETA VERSION)
(c)1991 By Oasis Pensive Abacutors and Western Horizon Technologies

Originally, sold by Western Horizon Technologies, was a small hardware device that plugged into your TI99 PIO port which allowed you to play the '90s PCM 8-bit sound file format found on the PC, Amiga, Atari ST, Mac.

Now, here is the TMS9900 Assembly Language Source Code release of the BETA VERSION which Oasis Pensive Abacutors wrote as test software for the device back in 1991, I don't recall there being another version released back in the day, there might have been, but anyway here is this version that makes use of the 32k (for short 10 second files), or expanded 128k VDP, or Rambo and Geneve memory for much longer.

You can also play the sounds via the TMS9919 chip, but not as well, the sound quality is less, but it is easy today to build your own Digi-Port hardware device, see these pages for more info:
